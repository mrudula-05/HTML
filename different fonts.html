    <h2><font color="red" face="Italic" size="5">HTML-Hyper Text Markup Language</font></h2>
    <p><font color="black" face="Garamond" size="4">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</font></p>
    <h3><font color="black" face="Verdana " size="5">Tags</font></h3>
    <p><font color="black" face="Tahoma" font weight="5">HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the end of that block of content. There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose. </font></p>
